# DotNetMicroservices

This is a Dot Net Example project for a demonstration of common code functionality.
I use Mongo DB as a Database and rabbitMQ as a message queue.
Common Code is a Project created as a NuGet package that can be used anywhere in the project or outside of the project.
This example project also demonstrates dependency injection and startup file code refactoring.



Technology used
1. Mongo BD
2. DotNet Core 3.1
3. RabbitMQ Message queue
